Welcome to my academic web page! My name is Sander (A.S.) Gielisse, and I am a computer science student from the Netherlands, currently pursuing my studies in the field of artificial intelligence at Delft University of Technology. Specifically, I am focusing on computer vision research at the Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics lab. As a native Dutch speaker, I am fluent in written and spoken Dutch, as well as English. On this page, you can find more information about my academic journey, research interests, and other professional pursuits.

I am thrilled to share that I will be embarking on a new adventure in early 2023, as I begin my PhD program at TU Delft. My research will center around implicit image representations, a fascinating area that I believe holds immense potential for the future of AI.

Throughout my studies, I have always been passionate about learning and exploring new concepts, technologies, and methodologies. My web page serves as a platform for me to share my work, insights, and experiences with the academic community and beyond. Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you find it informative and engaging!
