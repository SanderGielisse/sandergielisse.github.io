Hello and welcome to my academic web page! My name is [Your Name], and I am a 25-year-old computer science student from the Netherlands. Currently, I am pursuing my studies in the field of artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on computer vision at the Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics lab. As a native Dutch speaker, I am fluent in written and spoken Dutch, as well as English.

I am thrilled to share that I will be embarking on a new adventure in early 2023, as I begin my PhD program at TU Delft. My research will center around implicit image representations, a fascinating area that I believe holds immense potential for the future of AI.

Throughout my academic career, I have always been passionate about learning and exploring new concepts, technologies, and methodologies. My web page serves as a platform for me to share my work, insights, and experiences with the academic community and beyond. Thank you for visiting my page, and I hope you find it informative and engaging!
